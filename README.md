## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

This was created for project 4 in Udacity's Front End Deveoper Nanodegree.
For this project I performed the following web optimizations:
1. I removed external style sheet links, inlined CSS and removed all unused CSS styles.
2. I resized images for faster loading.
3. I removed DOM lookups from within for loops.
4. And I avoided calling the length method within for loops.
